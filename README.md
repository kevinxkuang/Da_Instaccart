This dataset is based on 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users in 2017. In this analysis report, I was able to find some interesting shopping pattern by using SQL, Tableau and Excel. 

There are some intereting patterns I've found

   1. The top 5 most popular items are Banana, Strawberries, Baby Spinach, Avocao, Organic Whole Milk. As a whole, fruits sells slight more than vegetables.
