Instacart is one of the most popular grocery shopping app now, you can use your smartphone to order your grocery with few tap, shopper will help you pickup everything you need and deliver to your door within 2 hours. Instarcart is a fast growing company, it was found on 2012, and it's available all over the country now.  This dataset is based on 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users in 2017. In this analysis report, I was able to find some interesting shopping pattern by using SQL, Tableau and Excel. 

There are some intereting patterns I've found

   1. The top 5 most popular items are Banana, Strawberries, Baby Spinach, Avocao, Organic Whole Milk. As a whole, fruits sell slight more than vegetables. 
    
       *SQL [Example ](https://github.com/kevinxkuang/Da_Instaccart/blob/master/SQL/case)
       
       *Excel [Example] (https://github.com/kevinxkuang/Da_Instaccart/blob/master/pivot%20table1.xlsb)
       
       
  2. About those popular items, they are also the most popular reordered items, Refer to the Tableau visualization, Banana still the king, the highest one. Items with low reorder rates disproportionately come from the pantry department.
       
  3. According to the [visualization]() of hours vs order, customer usually place orders between late morning and late afternnon. the peak hours about 10am and 3pm
   
  4. About half of customer orders occur within a week after a given customerâ€™s previous order.  The high volume of orders 30 days after a previous order is almost. In Conclusion,we can say that there are two type of customers, one is weekly and other one is monthy, refer to [visualization]() of Days Since Prior Order
